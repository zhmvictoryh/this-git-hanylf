    content: `Klinghoffer joined RHCP in 2009 following the departure of John Frusciante, who has now rejoined the band

Josh Klinghoffer is the latest guest to appear on WTF With Marc Maron, where he discussed his recent departure from the Red Hot Chili Peppers following the announcement that guitarist John Frusciante would be rejoining the band. (Klinghoffer replaced Frusciante in 2009, performing and recording with RHCP for 10 years.) According to Klinghoffer, the news was a “complete shock but not a surprise,” and he explains that, in the moment he was told he was out of the band, he felt a “great wave of love for them, and love for everything [he] was able to do with them.”

Maron and Klinghoffer proceed to discuss Klinghoffer’s past with RHCP, working with John Frusciante on his solo records, how their relationship changed once he initially joined the Peppers, his early life, and more. Klinghoffer also confirmed that he and the rest of the band recorded new material before Frusciante’s return, but that it will be scrapped. Check out the full episode above.

Alexander Kristoff will shake off seven years' worth of habit in 2020 as he skips the Tour de France for the first time since 2012 and returns to the Giro d’Italia.

The Norwegian enjoyed a strong 2019 season, winning his first major spring Classic since 2015 at Gent-Wevelgem, as well as winning six other races and finishing on the podium of the Tour of Flanders.
        
However, despite signing a new two-year contract with UAE Team Emirates, the 32-year-old has found his options limited in 2020, as Fernando Gaviria is the favoured sprinter for the Tour, while Tadej Pogacar and Fabio Aru go for the overall title.
        
"It's not 100 per cent ideal," Kristoff told Cyclingnews at a recent team training camp in Spain, trying to find the positives.
        
"I've never had a summer vacation as long as I've had kids – the whole summer it's always been 'daddy's in France' - so it will be nice to spend some time with them over the summer.

"I hope I'll do the Tour again in the future, but you never know. Maybe I've done my last Tour. I'm starting to get older. Still, I hope I have a chance to go back." ...`,

    content: `San Diego was included because of “irresponsible breeding, severing bonds and treating elephants like expendable assets,” according to In Defense of Animals, a San Rafael organization that has been compiling the list since 2004 and has long been opposed to elephants being kept in zoos. This is the second time San Diego has been included.

“We do the list every year to draw attention to the fact that elephants suffer in captivity,” said Laura Bridgeman, director of the group’s elephant campaign. “No amount of space, financial investment or enrichment in public display facilities can completely eliminate the physical and psychological harm that captivity perpetuates for elephants.”
        
San Diego Zoo Global officials did not respond to multiple requests by phone and email for their reaction to the list, which was released Thursday. They have two Asian elephants and one African elephant at the zoo, and nine African bush elephants at the Safari Park.`,

    content: `Three popular diets alongside the habit of not eating for significant periods of time have been linked to important health benefits that extend beyond weight loss. The findings come from the University of Otago, which reports that things like lowered blood sugar and blood pressure as among the benefits associated with these diets and fasting, each assessed in a ‘real world’ setting.

Trendy diets come and go, but some manage to stick around for long periods of time, even earning endorsements from health organizations and recommendations from doctors. One such diet is the popular Mediterranean diet, which has repeatedly been linked to various positive health changes in many studies over the years. Two other popular dieting protocols evaluated by the recent study are Intermittent Fasting and Paleo diets.
        
Researchers studied all three of these diets with the goal of seeing how effective they are in the real world rather than a clinical one, meaning the participants — all 250 of them — were tasked with picking which diet they preferred and sticking to it on their own without any continued support from a dietician.
        
The study found that all three dieting protocols conferred health benefits, though certain diets were more associated with select benefits than others. Intermittent fasting, for example, which involves going 12 to 18 hours without eating, was linked with greater weight loss — this isn’t a surprise considering that the participants only ate around 500 calories per day on two days per week.
        
Compared to this, the participants who went on a Mediterranean diet were more likely to experience improved blood sugar levels. Both fasting and the Mediterranean diet were linked with ‘significant improvements’ in the participants’ blood pressure measurements, as well. Controlling blood pressure is an important factor in reducing the risks of heart disease and a number of other health issues.`,
